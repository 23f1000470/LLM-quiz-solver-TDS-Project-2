An intelligent, autonomous agent built with LangGraph and LangChain that solves data-related quizzes involving web scraping, data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks. The system uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model to orchestrate tool usage and make decisions.

## 🔍 Overview

This project was developed for the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course project, where the objective is to build an application that can autonomously solve multi-step quiz tasks involving:

- **Data sourcing**: Scraping websites, calling APIs, downloading files
- **Data preparation**: Cleaning text, PDFs, and various data formats
- **Data analysis**: Filtering, aggregating, statistical analysis, ML models
- **Data visualization**: Generating charts, narratives, and presentations

The system receives quiz URLs via a REST API, navigates through multiple quiz pages, solves each task using LLM-powered reasoning and specialized tools, and submits answers back to the evaluation server.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project uses a **LangGraph state machine** architecture with the following components:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   FastAPI   │  ← Receives POST requests with quiz URLs
│   Server    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Agent     │  ← LangGraph orchestrator with Gemini 2.5 Flash
│   (LLM)     │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
       ▼            ▼            ▼             ▼              ▼
   [Scraper]   [Downloader]  [Code Exec]  [POST Req]  [Add Deps]
```

### Key Components:

1. **FastAPI Server** (`main.py`): Handles incoming POST requests, validates secrets, and triggers the agent
2. **LangGraph Agent** (`agent.py`): State machine that coordinates tool usage and decision-making
3. **Tools Package** (`tools/`): Modular tools for different capabilities
4. **LLM**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash with rate limiting (9 requests per minute)

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Autonomous multi-step problem solving**: Chains together multiple quiz pages
- ✅ **Dynamic JavaScript rendering**: Uses Playwright for client-side rendered pages
- ✅ **Code generation & execution**: Writes and runs Python code for data tasks
- ✅ **Flexible data handling**: Downloads files, processes PDFs, CSVs, images, etc.
- ✅ **Self-installing dependencies**: Automatically adds required Python packages
- ✅ **Robust error handling**: Retries failed attempts within time limits
- ✅ **Docker containerization**: Ready for deployment on HuggingFace Spaces or cloud platforms
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: Respects API quotas with exponential backoff
